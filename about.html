      <h1>About Kao</h1>
      <h2>Gist</h2>
      <p>
        I am a CS sophomore at Amherst College with experience coding in Java
        and a passion for software engineering. I also like communications and
        working with others. Outside of tech, I am one of the musical directors
        of DQ, one of the school's a capella groups, and I am a DASAC dancer! I
        also like playing the guitar, eating/making food, and sleeping :)

        aunt of 3 girls.
